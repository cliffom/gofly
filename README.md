# gofly - animation fun with a terminal and Golang

This is a terminal based animation demo written in Go.

## Show me the flies!

```sh
# Run with a default number of 50 flies
make run

# Build and run with a defined number of flies
make build
./gofly -flies 5

# Get help
./gofly -h
```

## Example output

My love for Golang, my fly problem, and Lucas's wasp problem.
